# DS2002_Snyder_Project1

This project performs ETL on a relational OLTP with bank transactions using SQL, MongoDB, Python, and API.

Files Project1_CreateTables.sql and Project1_LoadData.sql create the OLTP.

The Python notebook Project_1_Bank_ETL.ipynb performs all operations. This file also references an API made from bank_branch.csv as well as SQL files Project1_Create_DimDate.sql and Project1_Integrate_DimDate.sql
